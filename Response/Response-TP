Apache Kafka
Communication problems


Why Kafka ?
https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#introduction

Answer these questions with what you can find on the documentation :

What problems does Kafka solve ?
Kafka is an event streaming ensures a continuous flow and interpretation of data so that the right information is at the right place, at the right time.

Which use cases ?
To process payments and financial transactions in real-time, such as in stock exchanges, banks, and insurances.
To track and monitor cars, trucks, fleets, and shipments in real-time, such as in logistics and the automotive industry.
To continuously capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices or other equipment, such as in factories and wind parks.
To collect and immediately react to customer interactions and orders, such as in retail, the hotel and travel industry, and mobile applications.
To monitor patients in hospital care and predict changes in condition to ensure timely treatment in emergencies.
To connect, store, and make available data produced by different divisions of a company.
To serve as the foundation for data platforms, event-driven architectures, and microservices.

What is a producer ?
Producers are those client applications that publish (write) events to Kafka.

What is a consumer ?
consumers are those that subscribe to (read and process) these events.

What are consumer groups ?

What is a offset ?

Why using partitions ?

Why using replication ?

What are In-Sync Replicas (ISR) ?



Try to install Kafka without docker
https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#gettingStarted

Use kafka with docker
Start multiples kakfa servers (called brokers) by downloading a docker compose recipe :

https://github.com/conduktor/kafka-stack-docker-compose#single-zookeeper--multiple-kafka
Check on the docker hub the image used :

https://hub.docker.com/r/confluentinc/cp-kafka
Verify
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS         PORTS                                                                                  NAMES
b015e1d06372   confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1       "/etc/confluent/dock…"   10 seconds ago   Up 9 seconds   0.0.0.0:9092->9092/tcp, :::9092->9092/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9999->9999/tcp, :::9999->9999/tcp   kafka1

Getting started with Kafka
Connect to your kafka cluster with 2 command-line-interface (CLI)
Using Docker exec

docker exec -ti my_kafka_container_name bash
> pwd
> kafka-topics 
# will give you help to use this command
> kafka-topics --describe --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 
# will give you an error
Read this blog article to fix Broker may not be available. error : https://rmoff.net/2018/08/02/kafka-listeners-explained/

Pay attention to the KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS config from the docker-compose file.

Create a "mailbox" - a topic with the default config : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_createtopic
Check on which Kafka broker the topic is located using --describe
Send events to a topic on one terminal : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_send
Keep reading events from a topic from one terminal : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_consume
try the default config
what does the --from-beginning config do ?
what about using the --group option for your producer ?
stop reading
Keep sending some messages to the topic
Partition
Check consumer group with kafka-console-consumer : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#basic_ops_consumer_group
notice if there is lag for your group
read from a new group, what happened ?
read from a already existing group, what happened ?
Recheck consumer group
Replication - High Availability
Increase replication in case one of your broker goes down : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs
Stop one of your brokers with docker
Describe your topic, check the ISR (in-sync replica) config : https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#design_ha
Restart your stopped broker
Check again your topic
Using a Scala application with Kafka Streams to read and write to Kafka

Continuous Integration (CI)
If it works on your machine, congrats. Test it on a remote servers now thanks to a Continuous Integration (CI) system such as GitHub Actions :

How to use containers inside a CI : https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers
